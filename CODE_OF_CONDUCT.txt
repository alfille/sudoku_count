CODE OF CONDUCT

This is a simple project to explore an interesting math problem. (Creating SUDUKU candidates).

There is no place for rudeness, badgering, or hijacking discussions for unrelated issues, either 
commercial or political or idealogical. Find another forum, please. On the other hand, we welcome
any related discussion -- the point of the project is to share ideas.

So courtesy is expected, and contact me if anything here (even my entries) fail to meet these rather
inclusive standards.
